# CS353-Project3
This is a class project for reading from a text file and writing data out for simplified transactions.

# How to run
1. Open TransactionManager.rkt in DrRacket
2. Simply run the program!

# Changing input/output files
By default, the program opens files called ACCOUNTS.TXT and STATEMENTS.TXT, while outputting TRANSACTIONS.TXT in the same directory. If you wish to change them, you can do the following:

To change the input files, navigate to TagValues.rkt, and change the filenames on lines 100-101

To change the output file, navigate to TransactionManager.rkt and change the filename on line 111
